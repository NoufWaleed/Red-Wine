# Red-Wine

Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
I choose Red wine to analysis.
This data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Guiding Question: 
Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?

## Getting Started

you should have (data.table) and (ggplot2) packages if you want to run the rdm file.

### And coding style tests

The file formatted in markdown and contain: 
1- A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data.
2- A section at the end called “Final Plots and Summary”
3- A final section called “Reflection”

In the HTML file i hide the codes by using the following:

```
{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}
```
